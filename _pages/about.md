Hi, I'm Taekseung and I am currently Fifth year's masters student in CMU. I did my undergraduate and master's research under professor [Guy Blelloch](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~guyb/index.html).

My work spans **graph algorithms, parallel algorithms, and parameterized algorithms**. I worked on Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search problem(ANNS), and Parallel Tree Decomposition methods before. I am also interested in **database theory**, especially about tractable queries. I did works on computational ethics, where we work on showing philosophical concepts by simulation. I do keep [blog posts](https://medium.com/@taekseuk) about these topics, usually summarizing interesting posts that I see on web. 

During my free time, I love exercising. I do every sports besides soccer. I also live with two cute cats! See [here](https://www.instagram.com/leoandmo_ragdoll/).
