My research interests are in parallel algorithms, graph algorithms, query processing. I am generally interested in writing fast and scalable code for large unstructured datasets, both theoretically and empreically. Especially I am interested in optimization that is related to databases.

Other part of the research that I am interested in is application of these systems; Espcially in computational biology, where datasets are usually unstructured. I also do research with algorithmic game theory, where I focus on the computational simulation of specific business settings.

Some researches that I find interesting these days:
[tileDB](https://tiledb.com/) : Multi-dimensional array database that is used for biological, geological data.  
Query optimization related with graph analytics.  
Graph, string related genomics problems. 
Approximate nearest neighbor problems, especially using graph and bucket based methods.
